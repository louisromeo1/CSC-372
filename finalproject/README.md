# CSC372FinalProject

Authors: Louis Romeo, Anthony Hsu, Rachel Whitaker, Ellie Laton
Description: This project required writing a grammar for your new programming language and implementing a translator which converts your language into a desired programming language (we chose Python). The language we implemented consists of emojis, more specifically the emojis found on discord and their text equivalent. Our project contains many sample programs written in our emoji language that showcase all the features of our grammar, including while loops, integer, string and boolean expressions and operations, and more.


The main file is called emoji_translate.py
For use:
1) You move the .txt file with emoji code into the folder.
2) Run emoji_translate.py
3) in the command line, give it the file's name
4) find the output file (filename.py)
5) Run your new python file
