Description: For our final project, we were placed into teams and were tasked with creating a new programming language of our choosing and a translator to a high-level programming language. We set to create an emoji language, which uses the text description of the emojis found on Discord as a base. The grammar is written both in Backus-Naur and Extended Backus-Naur form and includes logic for integer, string and boolean operators and operations, an xor operation, while loops, etc. We coded a translator into Python and created various sample programs which display the various characteristics of our emoji language. The main file is called emoji_translate.py

For use:
1) You move the .txt file with emoji code into the folder.
2) Run emoji_translate.py
3) in the command line, give it the file's name
4) find the output file (filename.py)
5) Run your new python file
